# LiveWriting

I don't know if Live Writing is a real thing, but I'm looking forward to making it one. Live writing, to me, is when an
author write a book and pushes it live to a website each step of the way instead of waiting and publishing it. I would
like to get feedback along the way and plan to incorporate a forum for said feedback later on. In this description, I will
add sections and explain what is or will be in them.
